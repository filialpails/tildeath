~ATH
====

An esoteric language interpreter for the imminently deceased. Not Turing-complete!

~ATH looks like this:

```
import universe U;
import author Rob;

~ATH(U) {

  ~ATH(Rob) {
  
    // additional graves...

  } EXECUTE(NULL);

} EXECUTE(NULL);

THIS.DIE();
```
You can use a shebang line to directly execute scripts:
```
#!/usr/local/bin/~ath.rb
//etc...
THIS.DIE();
```
